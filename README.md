# Sorting Visualizer


## About: 
Web app that allows a user to visualize different sorting algorithms.  The sorting algorithms were written in vanilla JS, and the interface was developed using HTML and CSS.  I completed this project to solidify my understanding of sorting algorithms while also practicing front end development and UI/UX design.  


## Bubble Sort 
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(n2), where n is the number of items being sorted. 

First Pass:
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.  <br />
( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4 <br />
( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2 <br />
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them. <br />

Second Pass:
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) <br />
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2 <br />
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) <br />
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) <br />

And so forth.   <br />


## Selection Sort
Selection sort selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.  Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n2).

## Merge Sort 
Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.  Merge sort has a worst case time complexity of O(n log n).  

## To run the app:
Go to https://saraslee.github.io/sort-me/
Choose sorting algorithm you want to visualize and click start.  
Generate random array and click start to run the sort again.  

## Future additions:
Quick sort, shell sort
